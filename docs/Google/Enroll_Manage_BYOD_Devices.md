Android devices that have to be managed can either be an employee owned device or a corporate distributed devices. In Android Management, based on the
device ownership, you can either enroll in to work profile (Bring Your own device) or Work Managed (Corporate Device)

## What is the difference between work profile and work managed?
Work Profile based Android device management is best suited for employee owned devices. In this mode of management, the device memory is virtually divided in to two portions, with one portion being the work side and the other side being the personal side. Administrators can manage only the work side of the device and cannot control/manage/retrieve any data from the personal side of the device

Work Managed based Android device management is best suited for coporate owned devices. The device is fully managed. 

## Pre-requisites
1. Set up Android Enterprise
2. Select the enrollment mode (Default/Recommended: User Based) 

To Enroll a device in Android Enterprise Work Profile Mode:
1. Go to Play Store on the device and download WS1 Intelligent Hub
2. Launch the Intelligent Hub app and go through the enrollment process.
