This section provides an overview of key concepts for app management with Android Enterprise. This section also includes considerations for hosting your internal applications based on your use case.

## Managed Google Play
Managed Google Play is used by organizations to select and approve apps for use at work. End users access managed Google Play on their device to view a curated list of apps approved and assigned to them by their organization. Although the look and feel of managed Google Play is similar to public Google Play, the user cannot search for (or view) apps that haven't been approved or assigned to them. Organizations can also curate the user experience for managed Google Play by creating custom categories for approved work apps.

### How to access managed Google Play
You have two options to easily approve and manage your work apps in managed Google Play:

1) Use the managed Google Play iframe in the Workspace ONE UEM Console: This is the easiest way to add and approve new Android public apps, add new web apps, or even upload private apps to Google Play. On the Workspace ONE UEM console, navigate to Apps & Books > Applications > Native > Public > Add Application. Select Android under 'Platform' and click 'Search'.

2) Navigate to Managed Google Play in the browser: You can navigate to https://play.google.com/work and log in using the same Google account that was used to complete the registration process. Once you login, you can manage admins for your Android EMM registration or approve apps.
